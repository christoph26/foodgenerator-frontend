            <h3>About the foodgenerator.de Privacy policy </h3>
            At foodgenerator.de, Inc. (“foodgenerator.de”), we recognize the importance of your privacy. That said, it’s understandable that you may be concerned with the information you provide to us or that is collected by us and how we use and disclose it. With these concerns in mind, we’ve developed the foodgenerator.de Privacy Policy, outlined below. This Privacy Policy explains foodgenerator.de’ privacy practices for visitors to our Web site at foodgenerator.de (the “Web site”). By using our Web site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the foodgenerator.de Terms and Conditions. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a new policy on the Web site and update the “last updated” date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Web site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.

            <p></p>
            <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
            <br>• Personal Information: Personal information is information to specifically identify an individual, such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her purchases. Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies the individual.
            <br>• Aggregate Information: Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service might be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase might be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires. We might share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, such as helping us better understand and improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes.

            <p></p>
